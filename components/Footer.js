            Ceiling fans cool you in the summer and warm you in the winter, all
            for just pennies a day. They are extremely efficient: even at high
            speeds they use less energy than a 75-watt light bulb. Actually,
            fans save energy, with cooling costs alone lowered as much as 40
            percent, according to a study by Florida Power and Light. In the
            summer, fans create a wind chill effect that makes a temperature of
            78°– 80°F feel like 72°F. So by using them you can set your
            thermostat higher. On most fans, the summer setting is a
            counter-clockwise rotation, viewed from below. In the winter, fans
            run in reverse (clockwise), reclaiming lost heat from the ceiling.
            They provide an even, comfortable temperature by moving hot air back
            down to the living areas below. Even though ceiling fans have been
            around for more than a century, they are more popular today than
            ever. If you are planning a purchase, use these helpful tips to make
            a better buy.

            When shopping for a ceiling fan, you may find it difficult to
            determine why one costs $50 and another $500. At first glance there
            may appear to be no difference. Only when you begin to examine them
            closely, armed with the information that follows, will you be able
            to recognize the qualities that will assure years and years of
            beauty and comfort. Inexpensive fans may look good when new, and
            they may even run well at first. After continued use, however, they
            will become noisy; or they will warp, wobble or quickly wear out.
            Selecting a proper ceiling fan should be done as carefully as
            picking a piece of fine furniture.
          </p>
          <p class="text-black mt-4">
            The reason poorly made fans wobble is because of cheap blade
            materials, rotors and/or improper sealing processes are used. Blade
            brackets should have exact degrees of pitch or angles, while blades
            should be matched in carefully weighed and balanced sets.
          </p>

          <p class="text-black mt-4">
            Those that do wear out have undergone poor manufacturing techniques
            or inadequate testing and inspection. Other problems that promote
            wear and tear are incorrectly matched motor size and blade pitch.
            Defective motor windings can cause electrical shorts. And poorly
            installed on/off pull chains can be pulled out of the housing.
